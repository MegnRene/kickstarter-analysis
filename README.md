# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

 # Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to discover trends and useful advice based on data collected from Louiseâ€™s Kickstarter campaigns.  

## Challenges
In order to build a timeline to show how the length of campaigns and how they tied to the outcome, I had to convert the Unix timestamps to a readable format. Many other formulas were used to define more descriptive information on the Goals amount for all successful and failed campaigns, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. 

## Results
### Theater
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98067116/158515934-1e747aa6-503a-4f95-948b-8693ee12d4ab.png)

The most Successful Theater Outcomes were in May and June. The least successful Theater Outcomes were in December. January, June, July, and October all roughly had the same number of failed campaigns as successful.  The Theater category that had a goal of less than $5000 had a higher success rate. 
#### Great Britain 
Out of 604 campaigns for plays in Great Britain the theater category is the most successful.  We could create more charts for specific countries to compare where failure and success are more dominant. 

*Theater was very successful
